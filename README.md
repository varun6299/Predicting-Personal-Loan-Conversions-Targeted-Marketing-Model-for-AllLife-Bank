## üìå Problem
AllLife Bank wants to **convert more depositors into personal loan customers** to grow loan revenue.  
We build a **recall-optimized Decision Tree** model to identify likely accepters and surface actionable drivers for targeted marketing.

---

## üßæ Data
- **Demographics:** Age, Experience, Family size, Education level
- **Financials:** Income, CCAvg (monthly credit card spend), Mortgage
- **Products:** Securities Account, CD Account, Online Banking
- **Target:** `Personal_Loan` (1 = accepted, 0 = declined)

## üîç EDA ‚Äî Key Visual Insights

| Feature                | Observation |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Income**             | Accepters earn ~2.3√ó more than non-accepters |
| **Credit Card Spend**  | Accepters spend ~2.7√ó more monthly |
| **Education**          | Higher acceptance among graduates & professionals |
| **Family Size**        | Larger families (3‚Äì4 members) show higher acceptance |
| **CD Accounts**        | Strong cross-sell potential ‚Äî 3√ó higher incidence among accepters |

## üõ† Modeling Approach
- **Algorithm:** Decision Tree Classifier
- **Primary Metric:** Recall (reduce missed likely accepters)
- **Variants Tested:**  
  1. Baseline Decision Tree  
  2. Pre-pruned (max depth, min samples split/leaf)  
  3. Post-pruned (cost complexity `ccp_alpha`)

## üìà Results Comparison

| Model Variant        | CV Recall | Test Recall | Test Precision | Test Accuracy |
|----------------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| Baseline DT          | 0.92      | 0.88        | 0.914          | 0.981         |
| **Pre-pruned DT** ‚úÖ | **0.92**  | **0.89**    | **0.925**      | 0.982         |
| Post-pruned DT       | 0.91      | 0.88        | 0.912          | 0.981         |

> **Chosen Model:** Pre-pruned DT ‚Äî better precision with equal/better recall.

## üß† Business Takeaways
1. **Target high-income** depositors with premium benefit messaging.
2. **Engage high CCAvg spenders** with personalized offers matching spending categories.
3. **Focus on educated segments** ‚Äî position loans as enablers for professional/lifestyle growth.
4. **Highlight family benefits** for larger households.
5. **Cross-sell to CD/Securities account holders** to leverage trust and loyalty.
